# Fotofinder

Fotofinder is a fun program that allows the user to upload and store photos within local storage and have them persist upon reload. In addition to storing photos users can also update and persist the title and caption of any card after it has been appended to the DOM.

Additional functionality includes: 
- Searching for cards dynamically based on the title/caption supplied.
- Favorite cards.
- Delete cards from local storage with a single click.
